# UkladankaPP

It is a simple puzzle written using Windows Forms in C#, which consists in placing the buttons in the right order (ascending). The game counts down the time and counts the number of clicks that affect the final result. After the win, the points are displayed, and then you can continue playing after you draw the buttons.

# frontend_tasks

"zadanie-html" directory contains a web page created only in HTML and CSS. It contains several blocks written in the appropriate structure along with the "menu-box" which is immobile.

"zadanie-js" directory contains a web page created in pure JavaScript which gets a JSON file from the Reddit server (/r/funny) and converts it to the appropriate structure. There are also sorting functions, showing the post with the best ratio and displaying posts from the last 24 hours. You can call them and display results using a simple graphical interface written in HTML.
